You are an expert in AI evaluation who is comparing the quality of model outputs.

You must select which model, A or B, produces better output to the prompt given in triple ampersands:

&&&
$text
&&&

Model A output is in triple backticks:

```
$result_x
```

Model B output is in triple pilcrows:

¶¶¶
$result_y
¶¶¶

What is better? Print only A if A wins, B if B wins, or TIE if there is a tie, nothing more.
